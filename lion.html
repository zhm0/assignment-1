        The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus 
        Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, 
        broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; 
        and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; 
        adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. 
        It is a social species, forming groups called prides. 
        A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. 
        Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 
        The lion is an apex and keystone predator; 
        although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, 
        lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.
