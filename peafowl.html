        Peafowl is a common name for three bird species in the genera Pavo and Afropavo within the 
        tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae, the pheasants and their allies. Male peafowl are 
        referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens, although peafowl of 
        either sex are often referred to colloquially as "peacocks." The two Asiatic species are the 
        blue or Indian peafowl originally of the Indian subcontinent, and the green peafowl of Southeast 
        Asia; the one African species is the Congo peafowl, native only to the Congo Basin. Male peafowl 
        are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent 
        in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of covert feathers, which they 
        display as part of a courtship ritual.
