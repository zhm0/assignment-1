        Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes 
        that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The genus 
        Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the 
        western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas 
        is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is 
        included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans 
        after chimpanzees and bonobos. Gorillas are the largest living primates, 
        reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 metres, weights between 100 and 270 kg,
        and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex. They tend to live 
        in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The Eastern gorilla is 
        distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological 
        differences. Gorillas tend to live 35-40 years in the wild. The oldest gorilla known is 
        Fatou (b. 1957), who is still alive at the advanced age of 65 years.
